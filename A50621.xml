            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>COuld it be Imagined, that ungrateful Women, after so much laborious Drudgery, both by Day and Night, and the best of our Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits spent in your Service, you should thus publickly Complain? Certain we are, that there never was Age or Nation more Indulgent to your Sex; have we not condiscended to all the Methods of Debauchery? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented more Postures than <hi>Aretine</hi> ever Dreamed of! Been Pimps to our own Wives, and Courted Gallants even with the hazard of our Estates, to do us the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of making us not only Contented, but most obliged Cuckolds: Is he thought worthy to be esteemed a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that has not seaven times pass'd the Torrid Zone of a Venerial Distemper, or does not maintain, at least, a Brace of Mistress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47538:3"/> Generation before dull Ravens, though some think they live three hundred years: That our Island is a Paradise for Women, is verified still by the brisk Activity of our Men, who with an equal Contempt scorn <hi>Italian</hi> Padlocks, and defie <hi>French</hi> Dildo's, knowing that a small Doze of Natures Quintessence, satisfies better in a Female Limb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let silly Cits—complain never so much that Madam Money is Dead and Buried, we dare Appeal to all the Commissioners of <hi>Whetstones Park,</hi> the Suburb Runners, and <hi>Moorfields</hi> Night-walkers, if ever they had better Trading; Nay, have we not forced languishing Nature by preparations of Cantharides, spiced Meats, Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, Cullises, Jelly-broths, Lambstones, Diasatyrion, Bononia Sawsages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All to answer the height of your Amorous Passions, and prevent the pitiful Letchery of an Artificial Tranguin. Have we not with excess of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience borne your Affronts, been Sweated, Purged, Fluxed between two Feather-beds, Flog'd, Jib'd, and endured all the rest of the Devils Martyrdoms, and will you still offer to Repine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But why must innocent COFFEE be the object of your Spleen? That harmless and healing Liquor, which Indulgent Providence first sent amongst us, at a time when Brimmers of Rebellion, and Fanetick Zeal had intoxicated the Nation, and we wanted a Drink at once to make us Sober and Merry: 'Tis not this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table settle Brain that shortens Natures Standard, or

            <p>As for our taking Tobacco you have no reason to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, since most of your own Sex are so well skilled in managing a pipe; and if you find that of your Husbands to be naught, 'tis his natural infirmity, or your own perpetual Pumping him (not drinking Coffee) is the occasion of the defect, and therefore let such <hi>Tom Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things</hi> be forbidden the decoction of the rare <hi>Arabian</hi> Betry, and condemned everlastingly with the rest of doelittles Congregation, to the carrying of Glister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes for the use of the well effected Sisterhood.</p>

            <p>Cease then for the Future your Clamours against our civil Follies. Alas! alas!
